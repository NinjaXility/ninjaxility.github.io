# Local Toolkit

Tools that stay where they belong: on your machine.

No accounts. No metrics. No cloud.

Just tools that work when you need them, then get out of the way.

## Why This Exists

Most software today assumes you want an account, a subscription, a dashboard.

This doesn’t.

It assumes you want to get something done, keep it to yourself, and leave no trace.

Tools should serve you, not surveil you.

## What’s Here

### **Active Tools**
Ready now. Flashcards, formatters, encoders. Utilities built for utility.

### **Incubating Ideas**
Half‑formed, quiet, unpolished. Some things aren’t finished because they don’t need to be.

### **Future Problems**
Space held for what matters later. Not every tool needs to exist now.

## Flashcards

Your notes. Your memory. Your machine.

Flashcards live in your browser and nowhere else.  
They’re for remembering what you choose to remember. Without algorithms, notifications, or “engagement.”

Repetition. Recall. Rest.

## How It’s Built

- React + Vite + Tailwind  
- No server code  
- No analytics  
- No telemetry  

If it breaks, the console tells you why.  
If it works, it works until you close the tab.

## What This Is Not

- ❌ A SaaS platform  
- ❌ A social network  
- ❌ A growth hack  
- ❌ A venture‑backed “solution”  
- ❌ A polished product  

It’s a toolbox.  
It’s local.  
It’s quiet.

## If You Want to Contribute

Build for the person who opens the tool, uses it, and closes it. Without ceremony, accounts, or data trails.

###### P.S: Which is me, you and everyone else :)

Complexity is easy. 
Restraint is hard.

## License

Use it.  
Change it.  
Break it.  
Fix it.

It’s your machine.  
These are your tools.
